## Workflow
- *Always* fetch and pull before starting to work
- *Always* check you are working on the correct branch 
- *NEVER* work on master directly
- For every feature/update, create your own branch and add all new codes to this branch
- When feature is completed, submit a pull request
- Check to see if there are any conflicts and resolve any (also notify Cici/Sheila about this)

## Things to Remember
- If you have any issues with flutter, try flutter doctor -v to see what's going on
- Try to Google any issues
- Feel free to reach out to other members (especially Cici and Sheila)
- Try not to throw your computer in the trash when you encounter a bug
